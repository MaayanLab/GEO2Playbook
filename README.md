What is GEO2Playbook?
GEO2Playbook is a browser extension for extracting datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and then piping those lists to the Playbook Workflow Builder, an analysis tool. In its current form, it embeds a link for each GEO study on a search page that when clicked, directs a user to the Playbook Workflow Builder homepage. The next step to this development is to implement the automatic uploading of a dataset to the Playbook through this extension.
